/* The Java side of the game -- classes.dex -- reimplemented as native hooks.
 *
 * PvZ2's C++ engine calls back into Java constantly: for the screen size, the
 * .obb path, device info, config storage, input events, achievements. On a
 * device those calls land in com.popcap.SexyAppFramework.* and are answered by
 * the Android framework. There is no Dalvik here and writing one would be
 * absurd, so instead every method the engine actually invokes is implemented
 * natively, keyed by the (class, method) pair it names through JNI.
 *
 * The layering is deliberate:
 *   dex/jni_env.cpp  -- the fake JNIEnv/JavaVM themselves: object model,
 *                       string handling, arrays, reference management. Nothing
 *                       game-specific.
 *   dex/hooks/*.cpp  -- one file per Java class, holding only that class's
 *                       methods. This is where behaviour that was
 *                       ground-truthed against the decompiled classes.dex
 *                       lives, and where a new class gets added.
 *
 * Splitting it this way is what makes the answers auditable: each hook sits
 * next to a note saying what the real Java does and why this port answers the
 * way it does, instead of being one anonymous branch in a 200-line if-chain.

/* --- guest-memory layout of the fake JNI --------------------------------- *
 *
 * JNIEnv* is really a `struct JNINativeInterface**`: a pointer to a pointer to
 * a table of function pointers. Both levels are built in the emulated address
 * space, with every slot wired to its own SVC trampoline, so a JNI call from
 * guest code traps straight back to us and we know exactly which slot it was.
 *
 * WHERE they sit is not decided here -- runtime/guest_memmap.h owns the whole
 * sub-image layout and checks at build time that these do not collide with the
 * trampoline table, the scratch area or each other. Only the SVC number bases,
 * which are not addresses, belong to this layer. */
