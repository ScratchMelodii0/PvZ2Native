 * of this size, so the array grows as n^2) against tens of megabytes of guest
 * image. The limit that actually binds is guest address space, and map_module
 * checks that per module and says so.
 *
 * Running out of table entries is a HARD ERROR, not a warning. A DT_NEEDED

 * every symbol it exports falls through to a host trampoline that nothing
