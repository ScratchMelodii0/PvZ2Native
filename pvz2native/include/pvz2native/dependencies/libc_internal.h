 * Two shapes exist and they are not interchangeable:
 *  - a direct variadic call (printf, sprintf): arguments follow AAPCS, so the
 *    first four words are r0..r3 and the rest are on the stack past sp.
 *  - a va_list call (vsnprintf, __android_log_vprint): on ARM EABI a va_list is
 *    just a pointer to a contiguous argument block, so everything is read from
 *    guest memory at increasing addresses.
 * Getting this wrong is silent -- the format still "works", it just prints the
 * wrong words -- so the distinction is explicit at every construction site. */

 * spread over three files -- strcmp/strncmp in libc_string, wcscmp/wcsncmp in
 * libc_wchar, and strcoll/wcscoll in libc_locale, the last two being verbatim
 * copies of the first two (in the C locale, collation IS byte order, which is
 * exactly why they were copied rather than shared).
 *
 * Both read (a, b) from r0/r1 and write the result to r0, so a handler is a
 * single call.
 *
 * `limit` is the maximum number of elements to compare; kUnbounded for the
 * n-less forms. `stop_at_nul` ends the comparison at a terminator, which is what
 * separates the string family (strcmp, wcscmp) from the memory family (memcmp,
 * wmemcmp). `fold_case` lowercases both sides first, for strcasecmp. */
