/* Everything the harness fabricates in guest memory below the loaded image.
 *
 * The .so is placed at PVZ2_SO_BASE (0x00100000) and the import trampolines at
 * PVZ2_TRAMPOLINE_BASE (0x00001000). The ~1MB gap between them is free real
 * estate, and the harness fills it with structures the guest must be able to
 * read and call: the fake JNIEnv and JavaVM vtables, opaque JNI handles, scratch
 * for fabricated jstrings, and the placeholder objects passed to
 * Native_GameAppInitialize.
 *
 * Those addresses used to be declared in six different files -- dex/dex.h,
 * runtime/guest_runtime.h, dependencies/libc_unistd.cpp, engine/boot.cpp,
 * engine/lifecycle.cpp and the loader's own private #defines -- so no single
 * place said what the layout was, and nothing checked that two regions did not
 * overlap. Two of them were already only 0x800 apart with no note saying so.
 * Collecting them here costs nothing at runtime and makes an overlap a build
 * error instead of memory corruption with no plausible symptom.
 *
 * Everything here is an ADDRESS in the emulated space. The opaque token
 * namespaces (guest fd tokens, FILE* cookies) are NOT addresses even though they
 * are also small integers -- see kFdTokenBase in guest_runtime.h. They are never
 * dereferenced, so they may numerically overlap this map without meaning
 * anything, and they deliberately do.

 * original", which is what makes a hook a hook rather than a replacement.
 *
 * They live here, below the image, rather than in the guest heap: hooks are
 * installed before the heap exists, and their addresses must stay fixed for the
 * life of the process because the rewritten instruction in the .so points at
 * them and dynarmic caches that translation.
 *
 * kHookIslandStride is 16 rather than the 8 bytes two ARM words need, so a

 * and invalidate every already-cached translation. */
