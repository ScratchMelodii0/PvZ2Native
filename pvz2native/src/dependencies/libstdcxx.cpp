/* libstdc++.so / libgcc -- the ARM C++ runtime support the engine imports.
 *
 * Only the unwinder entry point needs real behaviour. libPVZ2.so is built with
 * exceptions, and when one is thrown the personality routine asks
 * __gnu_Unwind_Find_exidx for the ARM exception index table covering the
 * throwing PC. Returning 0 (the old silent stub) means "no unwind information
 * here", which turns every throw into an immediate terminate -- and since the
 * engine catches its own exceptions for things like missing resources, that
 * failure would look like an unexplained abort far from its cause.
 *
 * The table is a real segment of the loaded image: PT_ARM_EXIDX, which the ELF
 * loader now records (26962 entries in this build).

 * The pc argument is load-bearing as soon as more than one module is mapped:
