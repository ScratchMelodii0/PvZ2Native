/* com.popcap.SexyAppFramework.GooglePlay.{GooglePlayConnect, GooglePlayAchievements,
 * GooglePlayLeaderboard} and com.popcap.SexyAppFramework.cloud.Cloud
 *
 * The online services. None of them exist in this port, and none of them need
 * to: the engine treats "not signed in" as an ordinary state a real device is
 * in most of the time, so it degrades to local-only play without complaint.
 *
 * Every name below was taken from the decompiled classes.dex and cross-checked
 * against the string table of libPVZ2.so itself, because the previous version
 * of this file was written from memory of what the API "should" look like and
 * every single entry was dead: it registered `com/popcap/SexyAppFramework/Cloud`
 * and `.../GooglePlayConnect`, while the engine names
 * `com/popcap/SexyAppFramework/GooglePlay/GooglePlayConnect` -- these classes
 * live in subpackages -- and methods like Play_UnlockAchievement and Cloud_Sync
 * do not exist in any build. A hook keyed on a name nothing ever sends is
 * invisible: it does not warn, it just never runs. Verify a class path against
 * `strings libPVZ2.so` before adding one here.
 *
 * That correction changes no behaviour, and saying so is the point of this
 * file: these methods are void or boolean, so the unhooked default (nothing /
 * false) was already the answer they now give explicitly. They are written down
 * so the silence is a decision, and so a later change to the unhooked default
 * cannot quietly tell the engine it is online and leave it waiting on a
 * callback that will never arrive.
 *
 * GooglePlay/* is new in 4.5.2; 1.6 names none of these classes.
