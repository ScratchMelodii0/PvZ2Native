/* The session: everything the guest needs to stay alive between frames, and

 *
 * It exists because the HOST drives the frame loop. SDL has to pump its message
 * queue and swap buffers around every Native_onDrawFrame, which is impossible
 * while one call runs the entire boot and hundreds of frames to completion --
 * the window would never pump, Windows would mark it "Not responding", and
 * nothing would ever be presented.
 *
 * This file orchestrates and delegates. The four layers below it each answer a
 * different question, and keeping them apart is what makes supporting another
 * release of the game an additive change:
 *
 *   runtime/     how to run ARM code            (no game addresses at all)
 *   game/        where things are in this build (the per-version table)
 *   engine/      what to call, and in what order
 *   diagnostics/ how to ask the running guest a question
