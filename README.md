# PvZ2Native

📖 [Español](readme_spanish.md) · **English**

**Runs the real native library of *Plants vs. Zombies 2* for Android (`libPVZ2.so`, ARM32) on PC.** The only thing that is emulated is the **CPU**: PvZ2 exists only compiled for ARM (there is no x86/x64 build), so a JIT translates its ARM instructions to the native host architecture (x86_64 or arm64). Everything else — Android, JNI, libc, OpenGL ES, the filesystem — **is not emulated, it is reimplemented natively**, the same way **Wine** does with Windows.

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental project under active development. It boots as far as the main-menu load; rendering, audio and input are work in progress. **The game is not included**: you must supply your own `libPVZ2.so` and your own `.obb`.

---

## 📖 What it is (and what it is NOT)

It is not a *port* of the game's source code. It is a **hybrid of two techniques**, and the distinction matters:

- **Only the CPU is emulated.** The game binary is ARM machine code and PvZ2 was never compiled for x86/x64, so there is no way to run it directly on a PC processor. A JIT (dynarmic) reads those ARM instructions and translates them to the native host architecture (x86_64 or arm64) on the fly. This is the only "emulated" part.
- **Android is NOT emulated: it is reimplemented.** When the game calls an Android function (open a file, draw with OpenGL ES, allocate memory, invoke Java…), that call is serviced by **native PC code** that does the real work using the equivalent desktop API. There is no virtual Android running underneath; there is a **reimplementation** of the functions the game needs.

This is exactly **Wine's** approach — *"Wine Is Not an Emulator"* — taken one step further: Wine reimplements Windows calls without emulating anything because `.exe` files are already x86; here, because the game is ARM, the CPU has to be emulated as well. The rest of the philosophy is identical: **translate calls, don't simulate a whole machine.**

```

When the game asks the operating system for something (open a file, allocate memory, draw, play a sound, call into Java), that call leaves the emulated code as a trap and is serviced by a *handler* in this layer, backed by the equivalent PC API.

## 🧩 Architecture

The code lives in [pvz2native/](pvz2native/) and is split into layers under one strict rule: **only one layer may contain concrete addresses from the `.so`.** That is what makes supporting another game version a matter of adding data, not rewriting logic.

| Layer | Question it answers | May it hold a `.so` address? |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| [runtime/](pvz2native/src/runtime/) | How to run ARM code (JIT, heap, threads, synchronization) | **Never** |
| [game/symbols.cpp](pvz2native/src/game/symbols.cpp) | Where each thing lives in *this* binary | **The only one that may** |
| [engine/](pvz2native/src/engine/) | What to call and in what order (boot, lifecycle, frame) | Only via `sym()` |
| [dependencies/](pvz2native/src/dependencies/) | How to answer each Android `.so` (libc, libm, GLES, …) | No |
| [dex/](pvz2native/src/dex/) | How to answer the Java side (fake JNIEnv + per-class hooks) | No |
| [diagnostics/](pvz2native/src/diagnostics/) | How to interrogate the guest (watchpoints, PC sampling) | Only via `sym()` |

Notable pieces:

- **JIT:** [dynarmic](dynarmic/) (A32 frontend only). One JIT per guest thread, with an identity *page table* over the `.so`'s memory for speed.
- **Native dependencies:** one module per Android `.so` the game links against. libc is split by header (`string`, `stdio`, `stdlib`, `time`, `pthread`, `locale`, `ctype`, …), plus `libm`, `libz`, `liblog`, `libgles`, `libstdcxx`, `libopensles`, `libdl`. Each handler is a `void(GuestCall&)` registered by name.
- **Java side:** [jni_env.cpp](pvz2native/src/dex/jni_env.cpp) implements a fake `JNIEnv`/`JavaVM` (objects, strings, arrays, references); [dex/hooks/](pvz2native/src/dex/hooks/) has one file per Java class (`AndroidGameApp`, `AndroidSurfaceView`, HTTP, Google Play, Facebook…).
- **Graphics:** the game's GLES calls are translated to **OpenGL 2.0 (compatibility profile)** via `glad`; SDL provides the window and GL context, playing the role of Android's `GLSurfaceView`.
- **Resources:** a VFS translates Android paths to PC paths and reads assets from the game's real `.obb` (RSB/RSG format).

## 🎮 Supported game versions

The version is detected by a **byte fingerprint** at two known native functions; if none matches, boot is refused rather than running blind.

| Version | APK / OBB | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1.6.10** (2013) | `main.7.com.ea.game.pvz2_na.obb` | 🟢 Boots to the menu |
| **4.5.2** (2016) | `main.147.com.ea.game.pvz2_row.obb` | 🟢 Boots to the menu |

Adding a new version = one entry in `kVersions` in [symbols.cpp](pvz2native/src/game/symbols.cpp). Nothing in `runtime/` or `engine/` changes between versions.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **64-bit Windows or Linux**, or **macOS on Apple Silicon (arm64)**. There is no 32-bit host build — dynarmic ships host backends for x86_64, arm64 and riscv64.
- **CMake** (3.1+).
- **Windows:** MinGW-w64 (GCC with C++20 support).
- **Linux:** GCC or Clang with C++20 support.
- **macOS Apple Silicon:** Apple Clang / Xcode Command Line Tools, Ninja and Python 3.
- A **GPU with OpenGL 2.0** or higher.
- Your own legal game files. On macOS the easiest setup is **one APK + its matching OBB**; `compile-macos.sh` extracts the required ARM32 `libPVZ2.so` automatically.

---

## 🔨 Building

The project builds with CMake.
### Windows (MinGW)
The quick way is [compile.bat](compile.bat):
```bat
compile.bat
```

> [!NOTE]
> `compile.bat` has toolchain paths **hardcoded to the author's machine** (`CMAKE_C_COMPILER`, `CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`, `BOOST_ROOT`, `Python_EXECUTABLE`). Adjust them to your own before using it, or invoke CMake by hand:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

The executable ends up at:

```text
build/pvz2native/pvz2native.exe
```

Incremental rebuild (after the first `cmake`):

```bash
cd build
make pvz2native      # with the MinGW make
```

### Linux
The quick way is [compile.sh](compile.sh):

```bash
./compile.sh
```

`compile.sh` checks for the required tools (`cmake`, a C++ compiler, `make`/`ninja`, `unzip`), configures a Release build, compiles the project and copies or extracts the game assets from `game/` when they are present. By default full build output is saved to `build/compile.log` and a short summary is printed at the end.

Useful options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-c, --clean` | Delete `build/` before configuring |
| `-d, --debug` | Configure a Debug build |
| `-r, --release` | Configure a Release build (default) |
| `-j, --jobs N` | Compile with `N` parallel jobs |
| `-n, --no-assets` | Skip copying/extracting game assets |
| `-v, --verbose` | Print CMake/build output to the terminal |
| `-h, --help` | Show all options |

Examples:

```bash
./compile.sh                  # standard Release build
./compile.sh --debug --clean  # clean Debug build
./compile.sh --jobs 4         # Release build with 4 parallel jobs
./compile.sh --no-assets      # build only, do not touch game files
```

Or by hand:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

The executable ends up at:

```text
build/pvz2native/pvz2native
```

Incremental rebuild (after the first `cmake`):

```bash
cd build
make pvz2native
```

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

The macOS build runs **natively on Apple Silicon (`arm64`)**. PvZ2's Android
`libPVZ2.so` is still ARM32; Dynarmic translates that A32 guest code to the
AArch64 host at runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PvZ2Native does **not** include, host or download Plants vs. Zombies 2.
> You must provide files from your own legally obtained copy of the game.

#### Beginner setup — only two game files

You do **not** need to open the APK or extract `libPVZ2.so` yourself.

1. Clone the repository with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OptiJuegos/PvZ2Native.git
cd PvZ2Native
```

2. Install the macOS build tools if needed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

With Homebrew installed:

```bash
brew install cmake ninja python3
```

3. Open the `game/` folder and put exactly **one APK** plus its **matching OBB**
   directly inside it:

```text
PvZ2Native/
├── game/
│   ├── your-own-pvz2-copy.apk
│   └── main.<versionCode>.<package>.obb
├── compile-macos.sh
└── ...
```

For example, one of the currently supported OBB names is:

```text
main.147.com.ea.game.pvz2_row.obb
```

Do not rename the OBB. Its filename contains information used by the game.

4. Build:

```bash
./compile-macos.sh
```

The script will:

```text
check macOS / Apple Silicon tools
        ↓
find your APK and OBB in game/
        ↓
extract lib/armeabi-v7a/libPVZ2.so from the APK
        ↓
verify that libPVZ2.so is an ARM32 ELF
        ↓
configure CMake for native macOS arm64
        ↓
build PvZ2Native
        ↓
copy the prepared game files to build-macos/pvz2native/lib/
```

Nothing is downloaded from EA/PopCap and nothing from `game/` is committed by
Git.

5. When the build finishes, run:

```bash
./build-macos/pvz2native/pvz2native
```

On macOS a small native launcher appears before the game window. It only edits
the existing `[video]` settings in `config.ini`, so the normal configuration
system remains the single source of truth.

The launcher provides:

- starting resolution (`Auto`, `1280×720`, `1920×1080`, `Native`)
- `60 FPS`, `120 FPS` or `Unlimited`
- windowed or fullscreen start
- `Play` / `Cancel`

The executable is produced at:

```text
build-macos/pvz2native/pvz2native
```

and should report as a native Apple Silicon executable:

```text
Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

#### Advanced / original asset workflow

If you already extracted the Android library yourself, you can use the same
style as the original project:

```text
game/
├── libPVZ2.so
└── matching-file.obb
```

When both an APK and `game/libPVZ2.so` are present, the already extracted
`libPVZ2.so` takes priority.

#### macOS build options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-c, --clean` | Delete `build-macos/` before configuring |
| `-d, --debug` | Build Debug |
| `-r, --release` | Build Release (default) |
| `-j, --jobs N` | Use `N` parallel build jobs |
| `-n, --no-assets` | Build only; do not copy/extract game files |
| `-v, --verbose` | Print the complete CMake/build output |
| `-h, --help` | Show help |

Examples:

```bash
./compile-macos.sh --clean --release
./compile-macos.sh --debug
./compile-macos.sh --jobs 4
./compile-macos.sh --no-assets
```

The full non-verbose build log is saved to:

```text
build-macos/compile-macos.log
```

---

## ▶️ Running

### macOS

After `./compile-macos.sh` has prepared the build and your own game files:

```bash
./build-macos/pvz2native/pvz2native
```

The native macOS video launcher appears first; choosing **Play** continues into
the same PvZ2Native core used by the command-line executable.

### General / manual layout

1. Place the game files next to the executable, by default in a `lib/` folder:

   ```text
   build/pvz2native/
   ├── pvz2native(.exe)
   ├── config.ini            (generated automatically on first launch)
   └── lib/
       ├── libPVZ2.so
       └── main.7.com.ea.game.pvz2_na.obb
   ```

2. Run `pvz2native(.exe)`. On the first launch it writes a `config.ini` with every option documented and turned off.

If your files live elsewhere or you want to try 4.5.2, edit `config.ini`:

```ini
[paths]
so  = lib/libPVZ2.so
obb = lib/main.7.com.ea.game.pvz2_na.obb
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration (`config.ini`)

Single source of truth for paths and debugging (the old `PVZ2_*` environment variables are no longer read). Excerpt of the most useful sections:

| Section | Key | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[paths]` | `so`, `obb` | Paths to the `.so` and `.obb` (relative to the executable, or absolute). |
| `[log]` | `verbose` | One banner per `.init_array` entry and lifecycle call. |
| `[log]` | `trace` | Per-import-call trace. **Very loud** (~57 MB of stdout per run). |
| `[log]` | `pc_sample` | PC sampling / hot-frame slicing. |
| `[gl]` | `strict` | Queries GL state after every suspicious call and reports mismatches. |
| `[gl]` | `debug_clear` | A loud clear colour instead of the engine's opaque black. |
| `[runtime]` | `heap_quarantine` | Holds the N most-recently-freed blocks out of the reuse pool (hunts use-after-free). |
| `[game]` | `user_locale` | The locale the game is told about, e.g. `en_US`. |

---

## ⌨️ Controls

| Action | Control |
| --- | --- |
| Tap / select | Left click |
| Drag (swipe) | Left click + move |
| Type text | Keyboard (only when the game opens a field) |
| Confirm / Delete | `Enter` / `Backspace` |
| **Quit** | `ESC` or close the window |

The window is resizable: the scene renders at a fixed resolution and the compositor scales it, remapping clicks back into the game's space.
